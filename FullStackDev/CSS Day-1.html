    1.1 PROLOGUE
    Under cover of darkness late on the night of 5 August 1914, five columns of German
    assault troops, which had entered Belgium two days earlier, were converging on the town
    of Liege, expecting little resistance. To their surprise they were halted by determined fire
    from the town’s outlying forts. This was a setback for the Germans: control of Liege was
    essential before they could proceed with their main operation against France. They were
    forced to resort to siege tactics, using heavy howitzers. These fired shells up into the air
    and they plunged from a height of 12 000 feet to shatter the armour-plating of the forts.
    Strong though they were, these Belgian forts were not equipped to withstand such a batter¬
    ing for long; on 13 August the first one surrendered and three days later Liege was under
    German control. This was the first major engagement of the First World War, that horri¬
    fying conflict of monumental proportions which was to mark the beginning of a new era
    in European and world history.</p>
