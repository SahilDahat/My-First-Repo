    <h1 class="one">1.2 THE WORLD IN 1914</h1>  
<em>Europe still dominated the rest of the world in 1914 </em> <br>

<p class="two">
    Most of the decisions which shaped the fate of the world were taken in the capitals of
    Europe. Germany was the leading power in Europe both militarily and economically. She
    had overtaken Britain in the production of pig-iron and steel, though not quite in coal,
    while France, Belgium, Italy and Austria-Hungary (known as <b class="orange"> the Habsburg Empire </b> ) were
    well behind. Russian industry was expanding rapidly but had been so backward to begin
    with that she could not seriously challenge Germany and Britain. But it was outside
    Europe that the most spectacular industrial progress had been made during the previous 40
    years. In 1914 the USA produced more coal, pig-iron and steel than either Germany or
    Britain and now ranked as a world power. Japan too had modernized rapidly and was a
    power to be reckoned with after her defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of
    1904-5.
